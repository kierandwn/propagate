# propagate

PLACEHOLDER, WIP. CPP.

Propagator for generalised equations of motion. 

Key Features:
 - Core time propagator based on state-space model. System dynamics described outside core implementation. Will allow for use in a number of applications. 
 - General control definition, again outside core implementation for extensibility.
 - Sensor models to be included for estimation algorithm assessment.
 
Initially will be used to demonstrate content from the Coursera Spacecraft Dynamics & Control course, specifically the final Capstone project (Mars mission simulation). Then generalised to quadcopter dynamics & control, with a Kalman estimator in the loop.
